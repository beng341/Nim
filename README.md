# Nim
Project for CPSC 482 (Data Structures 2) at UNBC in September 2014. Authored by Ben Armstrong and Devin Calado.

The goal of the project was to implement Nim https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim where the player taking the last object loses.
Additionally, a player loses if they leave the board with either:
  -one pile of 1 stone, one pile of 2 stones, one pile of 3 stones or,
  -two piles of 2 stones, two piles of 2 stones

These refinements were chosen precisely so as to destroy the published mathematical theory behind the winning solution.
